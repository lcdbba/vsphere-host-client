# vsphere-host-client

Assisted installer for the vSphere/ESXi Web Client from @linuxcoding.org

This was initially set up to be used on a local machine (i.e. Laptop/Workstation)

I took this setup and made it so it can be run from a CentOS based server. I am sure
it would be just as easy to run from Ubuntu by replacing and adding some stuff into
the installer, but I personally prefer RPM based systems for servers. Feel free to
use as you wish. All I ask is it you fork or use the installer, please retain the header.
