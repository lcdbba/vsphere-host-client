# Possible values are:
#
# auto: Uses either VC or AuthZ based on the object for which information is
#       requested. For objects managed by VC 5.1 or earlier the information is
#       taken directly from the VC. For objects managed by VC 6.0 or custom
#       objects - the info is taken from AuthZ
#
# legacy: Gets the permission info using VC as backend for any object managed by VC.
#         For other objects uses AuthZ.
#
# authz: Always use AuthZ as source of information regardless of whether the object
#        is being managed by VC or not.
